# rotel 🌶️ 🍅
Node.js package for the Rotel lightweight OpenTelemetry collector.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/rotel-agent.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/rotel-agent)

## Description

This package provides an embedded OpenTelemetry collector, built on the lightweight Rotel collector. When started, it spawns a background daemon that accepts OpenTelemetry metrics, traces, and logs. Designed for minimal overhead, Rotel reduces resource consumption while simplifying telemetry collection and processing in Node.js applications—without requiring additional sidecar containers.

| Telemetry Type | Support     |
|----------------|-------------|
| Metrics        | Alpha       |
| Traces         | Alpha       |
| Logs           | Coming soon |

## How it works

By default, the Rotel agent listens for OpenTelemetry data over **gRPC (port 4317)** and **HTTP (port 4318)** on _localhost_. It efficiently batches telemetry signals and forwards them to a configurable OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) compatible endpoint.

In your application, you use the [OpenTelemetry Javascript SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/) to add instrumentation for traces, metrics, and logs. The SDK by default will communicate over ports 4317 or 4318 on _localhost_ to the Rotel agent. You can now ship your instrumented application and efficiently export OpenTelemetry data to your vendor or observability tool of choice with a single deployment artifact.

Future updates will introduce support for filtering data, transforming telemetry, and exporting to different vendors and tools.

## Getting started

### Rotel configuration

Add the `rotel` npm package to your project's dependencies. There are two approaches to configuring rotel:
1. JSON or typed config (Typescript) 
2. environment variables

#### Typed dicts

In the startup section of your `index.js` or `index.ts` add the following code block. Replace the endpoint with the endpoint of your OpenTelemetry vendor and any required API KEY headers. 

* Javascript * 
---
```javascript
const { Rotel } = require("rotel-agent");

const rotel = new Rotel({
  enabled: true,
  exporter: {
      endpoint: "https://foo.example.com",
      headers: {
          "x-api-key" : "xxxxx",
          "x-data-set": "testing"
      }
    },
})
rotel.start()
```

#### Environment variables

You can also configure rotel entirely with environment variables. In your application startup, insert:
```javascript
import rotel
rotel.start()
```

In your application deployment configuration, set the following environment variables. These match the typed configuration above:
* `ROTEL_ENABLED=true`
* `ROTEL_OTLP_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT=https://foo.example.com`
* `ROTEL_OTLP_EXPORTER_CUSTOM_HEADERS=x-api-key={API_KEY}`

Any typed configuration options will override environment variables of the same name.

---

See the [*Configuration*](#configuration) section for the full list of options.

### OpenTelemetry SDK configuration

Once the rotel collector agent is running, you may need to configure your application's instrumentation. If you are using the default rotel endpoints of *localhost:4317* and *localhost:4318*, then you should not need to change anything. 

To set the endpoint the OpenTelemetry SDK will use, set the following environment variable:

* `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317`

### Endpoint overrides

When using the OTLP exporter over HTTP, the exporter will append `/v1/traces`, `/v1/metrics`, or `/v1/logs` to the endpoint URL for traces, metrics, and logs respectively. If the service you are exporting telemetry data to does not support these standard URL paths, you can individually override them for traces, metrics, and logs.

For example, to override the endpoint for traces and metrics you can do the following:
```javascript
const { Rotel } = require("rotel-agent");

const rotel = new Rotel({
  enabled: true,
  exporter: {
      headers: {
          "x-api-key" : "xxxxx",
      },
      traces = {
        endpoint: "http://foo.example.com:4318/api/otlp/traces",
      },
      metrics = {
            endpoint = "http://foo.example.com:4318/api/otlp/metrics",
      }
  },
});
rotel.start();
```

Or, you can override the endpoints using environment variables:
* `ROTEL_OTLP_EXPORTER_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://foo.example.com:4318/api/otlp/traces`
* `ROTEL_OTLP_EXPORTER_METRICS_ENDPOINT=http://foo.example.com:4318/api/otlp/metrics`

All the OTLP exporter settings can be overridden per endpoint type (traces, metrics, logs). Any value that is not overridden will fall back to the top-level exporter configuration or the default.

### Retries and timeouts

You can override the default request timeout of 5 seconds for the OTLP Exporter with the exporter setting:

* `request_timeout`: Takes a string time duration, so `"250ms"` for 250 milliseconds, `"3s"` for 3 seconds, etc.

Requests will be retried if they match retryable error codes like 429 (Too Many Requests) or timeout. You can control the behavior with the following exporter options:

* `retry_initial_backoff`: Initial backoff duration
* `retry_max_backoff`: Maximum backoff interval
* `retry_max_elapsed_time`: Maximum wall time a request will be retried for until it is marked as permanent failure

All options should be represented as string time durations.

### Full OTEL example

To illustrate this further, here's a full example of how to use Rotel to send trace spans to [Axiom](https://axiom.co/)
from an application instrumented with OpenTelemetry.

The code sample depends on the following environment variables:
* `ROTEL_ENABLED=true`: Turn on or off based on the deployment environment
* `AXIOM_DATASET`: Name of an Axiom dataset
* `AXIOM_API_TOKEN`: Set to an API token that has access to the Axiom dataset

```javascript
// Add full example
```

For the complete example, see the [hello world](https://github.com/streamfold/rotel-nodejs-hello-world) application.

## Debugging

If you set the option `debug_log` to `["traces"]`, or the environment variable `ROTEL_DEBUG_LOG=traces`, then rotel will log a summary to the log file `/tmp/rotel-agent.log` each time it processes trace spans. You can add also specify *metrics* to debug metrics.   

## FAQ

### Do I need to call `rotel.stop()` when I exit?

In most deployment environments you do not need to call `rotel.stop()` and it is **generally recommended that you don't**. Calling `rotel.stop()` will
terminate the running agent on a host, so any further export calls from OTEL instrumentation will fail. In a multiprocess environment, such as
_gunicorn_, terminating the Rotel agent from one process will terminate it for all other processes. On ephemeral deployment platforms, it is
usually fine to leave the agent running until the compute instance, VM/container/isolate, terminate.
